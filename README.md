# Lap-Heroes
My first Python project. Back in High-school where I wrote my first "Hello World". I was so delighted with this new passion of mine I decided to made a freaking video-game using only Tkinter (spoiler: it is a terrible idea).  
DISCLAIMER: the code you are about to witness is dirty. Prepare your soul before cloning as it was my first approach of programming and DAMN I sucked at it.

# Commands
WASD: Movements.  
Space: Attack.  
E: Activate.  

# Usage
Since I was a terrible developper back then, I didn't know that paths could be relative. TL;DR every paths are absolute and I didn't know how to use system function to get current directory.
TL;DR 2 You have to set up the game path in 3 files on your own, good luck.

Modify custom_path variable on ***lapheroes.py***, ***BOSS/PACMAN/pacman.py***, ***BOSS/SNAKE/snake.py*** (~line 8).  
ex: I cloned the folder on ***'/Users/tblaudez/lapheroes'*** so I edited cutom_path to match this.  
Once done: ***$> python3 lapheroes.py***  
(yeah it's lame, i know)
