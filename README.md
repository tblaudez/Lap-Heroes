# Lap-Heroes
My first approach of the programming world by making a little video-game on Python (dirty code ahead).  
It was made with the Tkinter graphic library; the map is based on my senior high-school.

# Commands
WASD: Movements.  
Space: Attack.  
E: Activate.  

# Usage
Modify custom_path variable on lapheroes.py, BOSS/PACMAN/pacman.py, BOSS/SNAKE/snake.py (~line 8).  
ex: I cloned the folder on '/Users/tblaudez/lapheroes' so I edited cutom_path to match this.
Once done: ***$> python3 lapheroes.py***
