# Lap-Heroes
My first Python project. Back in High-school where I wrote my first "Hello World". I was so delighted with this new passion of mine I decided to made a freaking video-game using only Tkinter (spoiler: it is a terrible idea).  
DISCLAIMER: the code you are about to witness is dirty. Prepare your soul before cloning as it was my first approach of programming and DAMN I sucked at it.
